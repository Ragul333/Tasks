Pass by Value:
In Pass by Value, Function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function doesnâ€™t affect the variable passed from outside the function. so changing the value of the variable never changes the underlying primitive (String or number).

Pass by Reference:
In Pass by Reference, Function is called by directly passing the reference/address of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function affect the variable passed from outside the function. In Javascript objects and arrays follows pass by reference.so if we are passing object or array as an argument to the method, then there is a possibility that value of the object can change.
